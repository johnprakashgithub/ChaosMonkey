# ChaosMonkey
To implement the chaos monkey tests as a plugin using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), you can create a class-based structure that encapsulates the logic for disabling and enabling communication, as well as verifying it. This approach will make your code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

# Run the Tests
```
pytest test_communication.py
```
